            <div class="blog-title">FCA Updates on Car<br>Finance Commission<br>Complaints</div>
            <p class="paragraph">If you've used car finance to purchase a car, motorbike, or van, it's likely that the lender paid the broker (usually your car dealer) a commission for arranging the loan. Recent updates from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Court of Appeal have significant implications for such arrangements.</p>
            <p class="paragraph"><strong>Court of Appeal Ruling</strong></p>
            <p class="paragraph">On 25 October 2024, the Court of Appeal ruled on three cases involving car finance. The court determined that it was unlawful for dealers to receive a commission from the lender without first informing the customer about the commission and obtaining their informed consent.</p>
            <p class="paragraph"><strong>Informed consent requires disclosure of:</strong></p>
                <p class="paragraph">The amount of the commission.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">How the commission is calculated.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The lenders involved are appealing this decision to the Supreme Court. Until overturned, this ruling stands as law, and car finance providers must comply.</p>

            <p class="paragraph mt-4" >  <strong>Complaints About Discretionary Commission Arrangements (DCAs)</strong> <br /> 
                Before 2021, some lenders allowed brokers to adjust the interest rates offered on car finance. Brokers earned higher commissions by securing higher interest rates, creating a potential conflict of interest. These arrangements, known as discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs), were banned in 2021.</p>

            <div class="fw-bold" style="font-size: 1.1rem; ">Extended Timeframes for Complaints</div>
            <div class="fw-semibold" style="margin-bottom: 0.2rem;">To manage the anticipated volume of complaints following the Court of Appeal ruling, the FCA has extended deadlines:</div>
            <p class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 1.2rem;">Providers have until after <b>4 December 2025</b> to respond to complaints about all types of car finance commission. Consumers have until at least <b>29 July 2026</b> to refer complaints to the FOS.</p>

            <div class="fw-bold" style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 0.2rem;">FCA Review and Future Updates</div>
            <p class="paragraph">The FCA is currently reviewing DCAs and plans to announce next steps in May 2025. This review will also address complaints about non-DCA commission arrangements. The outcome may depend on the progress and decisions of the Supreme Court's appeal listed for April 2025.</p>
