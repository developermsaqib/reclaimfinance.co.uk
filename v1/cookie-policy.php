          <p style="font-size: 1rem;">It is necessary for this website to use cookies. In fact, most websites you visit will use cookies in order to improve your user experience by enabling that website to 'remember' you, either by creating session cookies (for the duration of your visit) or persistent cookies (for repeat visits). This makes the interaction between you and the website faster and easier. If a website does not use cookies, it will think you are a new visitor every time you move to a new page on the site – for example, when you enter your login details and move to another page it will not recognise you and it will not be able to keep you logged in. Cookies are also used to enable better targeting or marketing messages based on your location and/or browsing habits. Cookies may be 'first party cookies' (set by the website you are visiting) or 'third party cookies' (set by other websites who run content on the page you are viewing). Third Party cookies assist with collating information to assist with analytics or targeted marketing.</p>
